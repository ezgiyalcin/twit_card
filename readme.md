- **Character Limit:** Users are limited to a certain number of characters per tweet.

## Code Structure

The JavaScript (`main.js`) file handles the dynamic behavior of the tweet box, including placeholder interactions, character count, and tweet validation.

The HTML (`index.html`) file defines the structure of the web app, while the CSS (`style.css`) file provides styling.

## Styling

The app has a clean and user-friendly interface with a Twitter-like design. The styling is done using CSS, ensuring a responsive and visually appealing experience.
